Uses behavioral Verilog to describe a Moore finite state machine for a four input password combination lock. Implemented on the zybo z7-10 FPGA board. Vivado was used to simulate and program the board. This repo ommits the files generated by Vivado to program the board, and wavefrom results of the simulation.
